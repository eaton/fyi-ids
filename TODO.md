# TODO

- [x] Migrate existing ID generators, Hashers, and Parser/Validators to the new style.
- [ ] Settle the object/string hashing divide; right now the UUID hashing behavior is different than nano/pico hash.
- [ ] Consider optional url normalization helpers for URL hashing.
- [ ] Add branding support to all the ID validator/generators, potentially using [ts-brand](https://github.com/kourge/ts-brand).
